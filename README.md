# Rock Paper Scissors 



Rock paper scissors (also known by other orderings of the three items, with "rock" sometimes being called "stone," is a hand game, usually played between two players, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V).

I chose a  mix of dark and light colours which includes combination of perivinkel and turquoise for the backgrounds. The instruction page has a silver background.The buttons turn yellow on hover.The mixture of modern color scheme combination allows user to have a delightfull experiance.
