# Rock Paper Scissors 



Rock paper scissors (also known by other orderings of the three items, with "rock" sometimes being called "stone," is a hand game, usually played between two players, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V).

# Design & Typography

I wanted the game to look a bit like an modern game, and inspires by it's simplicity. To achieve that I chose a font of Gentium Book Plus that looked very peaceful and styled the game window like smoth and easy going with a mirthfull game.Font awsome is used for the icons.

# General Features

For the layout of the page, I chose to create a game window with two buttons on the left top corner which makes it clear for the user if they want to have a look at rules on how to play? or just reset the game after playing it once. Upon click on the Rules button,I chose to have the rules accessible in a modal Box  which is displayed on top of the current page. Which further explains the  "Rock, paper, scissors" game in order to avoid any confusion about the result I chose to display their symbols along with their meanings which is aimed to clarify the user and to have full confidence over the game.
